👋 Hi strangers, I wear many hats on any given day. My primary hats are `parent` to four great kids, `partner` to one amazing friend, and `Growth Engineer` 
[Shopify](https://shopify.com).

## My Values
- 🧪 Always be learning - fast feedback loops & experiments are accelerants
- :heart: Empathy - it unlocks discovery, safety, & growth
- 🤝 Collaboration is vital - _If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together!_
- 📦 Shipping is the ultimate feature - Continuously add incremental value
